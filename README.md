These apps were written while following the book [Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide (3rd Edition)](https://www.bignerdranch.com/books/android-programming/). They include sensible challenges and maybe some other touches.

Patterns used in the book are normally followed, but my lack of experience with Java and Android development really "shines". My work continues to derive from the book's examples mainly due to the challenges.
